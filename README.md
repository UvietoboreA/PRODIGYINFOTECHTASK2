## 🚢 Data Science in Action: Exploring the Titanic Dataset 🎯

As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I completed an exciting data analysis project using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, where I applied essential techniques in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.

## 📊 Key Highlights of My Analysis:
Data Cleaning: Resolved missing values using statistical imputations (mean/mode) to prepare the dataset for analysis.
EDA: Explored key relationships between variables like Pclass, Sex, and Survived using histograms, heatmaps, and pairplots.
Visualization: Created compelling visuals to identify trends, including:
Survival rates across different passenger classes and genders.
Correlations between numerical variables such as Age, Fare, and survival outcomes.

## 🔍 What I Learned:
This project strengthened my ability to work with messy datasets and derive meaningful insights. A major takeaway was understanding how survival chances were shaped by socioeconomic factors and passenger demographics.
